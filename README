1.  Download WAAT distributable from: https://github.com/WAAT/WAAT/blob/master/dist/WAAT_v1.0.zip

2.  Extract contents from this zip file in your project's lib folder (say: c:\myTestProject\lib)

3.  Copy your framework specific Script Runner file
        from: c:\myTestProject\lib\WAAT\samplescripts\com\thoughtworks\webanalyticsautomation\scriptrunner\SeleniumScriptRunner.java
        to your framework folder, say: c:\myTestProject\testsrc\com\abc\project\scriptrunner\SeleniumScriptRunner.java

4.  Update the package name in this copied SeleniumScriptRunner.java

5.  In your project settings / build file, add the following directory in the classpath references:
        c:\myTestProject\lib\WAAT\libraries

6.  WAAT uses log4j for logging. You can use your own log4j.jar, or the one bundled with WAAT
    (in c:\myTestProject\lib\WAAT\libraries folder)

7.  If you want to use the default log4j properties file in WAAT, then in your project settings / build file, add the
    following directory in the classpath references:
        c:\myTestProject\lib\WAAT\resources
    You will need to provide the absolute path to the log4j.properties when you use WAAT in your tests.

8.  In your existing tests, where you want to do Web Analytics testing, make the changes described in
    c:\myTestProject\lib\WAAT\docs\Changes in existing Tests.html
    (Content available in other file formats too in c:\myTestProject\lib\WAAT\docs)

    NOTE: Once enabled, remember to disable WAAT testing in your tests, unless you want all tests to do the Web Analytic testing. 

9.  Test data should be provided in a specific format as specified in the sample file available in:
    c:\myTestProject\lib\WAAT\sampledata\OmnitureTestData.xml
    Note: The delimiter to use is || (2 pipe symbols)
